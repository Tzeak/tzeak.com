	<p>So here's the problem.
	I like potato chips. But I wanna learn how to cook. But every time I try to learn how to cook, I'm pretty hungry already, so I reach for some potato chips to keep me going.
	And then I gorge on potato chips and my kitchen is a mess with an unfinished, ugly, uncooked meal.
	</p>
	<p>
	this is a metaphor for my life as a whole, where I get distracted by any project that I have. <br/> but i also have no ability to cook whatsoever.
	I can burn rice, and reclaim the rest by adding mixed veggies and bacon.
	I can warm a frozen waffle.
	When I have friends over trying to make pizza, I can magically turn that pizza into a breadbowl of tomato and cheese soup.
	</p>
	<p>
	But also, when I try to make an app, or read a book, or something that requires a little effort, I get distracted, inevitably, by easier, more mundane "potato chip type" entertainments, like reddit facebook hackernews.
	Part of the problem is that they're accessible. I'm thinking I'll rip out the internet altogether when i have time and control over my living situation.
	But also part of the problem is that they're habits that are built in and I need to change my environment to change those habits.
	</p>
	<p>
	But a (possibly Adderall-fueled) emotional argument/debate later with some coworkers - they did make a terrific point that it's important to start small.
	And my parents, who have heard the tired tirade of "I should move out and take control of my life maybe a little to break these habits even though that's not the most cost effective thing to do right now"
	suggested me making breakfast Sunday mornings.
	and you know what -  <br/>
	I should actually do things.
	<br/>
	Also, there's no point of going to the doctor and figuring out you have ADHD and not using the techniques and medication to your advantage. 
	My goals that would "fix things" have always definitely been too big to be immediately achievable, so I end up doing nothing. That's why I haven't written anything for this stupid website till right now.
	And that's a good point.
	Even if i totally killed it with that potato chips analogy. That was a good analogy.
	So today, I'm not gonna bother with completely getting rid of potato chips. Today I'm just gonna do shit. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Today is the first day of control.
	This means, Sunday Morning Breakfast Burritos.
	Ingredients: Scrambled Eggs, Salsa, Pancetta, Green and Red Bell Peppers and Onions, Green Onions, on two mildly burnt flour tortillas that were too small for the portions I put in.
	They were all right. 
	The ultimate aim is to have a dinner party where I cook cool junk. Koshary? Invite everyone over. When I have a housewarming in a strange aloof apartment and work on cool shit all the time.
	And then maybe if
	</p>
	<p>I hope that these kind of posts will become a habit and I can change my other habits from here. Sunday feels like a good day to do shit. I hereby dub sundays as do shit sundays.</p>
